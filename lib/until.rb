# 4. Let's get the second test passing by coding our solution in `until.rb`:
# Fill out the content of the `using_until` method to `puts` the desired phrase, "Wingardium Leviosa", until our levitation force equals `10`. Remember, every time you `puts` the phrase, you should increment your levitation force by `1`.

def using_until
  levitation_force = 6
  until levitation_force == 10
  puts "Wingardium Leviosa"
    levitation_force += 1 
end
end
